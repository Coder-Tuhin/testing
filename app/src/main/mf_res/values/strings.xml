    <string name="fact_beta">Beta is a measure of the volatility of the portfolio to that of the index. In simple words it shows the movement of the portfolio in comparison. The Higher the Beta, higher the volatility of the scheme to the index. If its greater than1 , then the portfolio is highly volatile to the movemnts in the index. If the beta is lesser than 1 , then scheme is less volatile to the index and beta which is close to 1 implies that the scheme is closely following the index.</string>
    <string name="fact_turn_over">The turnover ratio represents the percentage of a fund\'s holdings that change every year.To put it simply, a turnover rate of 100 per cent implies that the fund manager has replaced his entire portfolio during the period given.Technically, the turnover ratio is the lower of the total sales or total purchases over the period divided by the average of the net assets.Higher the turnover ratio, greater is the volume of trading carried out by the fund.</string>
    <string name="fact_sd">Standard Deviation is the measure of the deviation in the returns of the portfolio. In Simple Words it tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal return.</string>
    <string name="fact_jensen_alpha">It measures whether the Scheme is generating excess returns over the normal returns.For example, if there are two mutual funds that both have a 12% return, a rational investor will want the fund that is less risky.If the value is positive, then the portfolio is earning excess returns. In other words, a positive value for Jensen\'s alpha means a fund manager has \'beat the market\' w with his or her stock picking skills. The Higher the value the better the performance.</string>

    <string name="notepledge2">⦁	The shares seen by you in the options above\n\n
i.	Lying in your demat a/c ( Shares in DP )\n\n
ii.	Shares that are lying with Ventura Securities  Shares in Ventura Beneficiary (VB).\n\n
⦁	You can select the shares from both the above options to pledge to Ventura, thereby enhancing your buying power.\n\n
⦁	Once you select the shares to be pledged the system shows you the approximate amount that would be available as margin (this is after adjusting the hair cut value)\n\n
⦁	The quantity to be pledged by you should be equal to or less than the available quantity in both the options (DP and VB)\n\n
⦁	Once you click on the Pledge button, system will direct you to the NSDL Page where you will be able to see all those stocks which you wished to pledge. You need to select those stocks on the NSDL Page and click on the submit button. You will immediately receive an OTP from NSDL which you need to validate on the NSDL Page after which the shares in you DP are marked as pledge.\n\n
⦁	Incase you sell the shares post you pledge them, the pledge would fail if the quantity in your DP is not found to the extent of the quantity you have pledged.\n\n
⦁	Facility for pledge is available to you on all trading days between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm\n\n
⦁	Charges for pledge would be Rs.15/- + GST....\n\n

    <string name="notepledge3"><b>Shares Receivable</b>\n\n
</string>
    <string name="notepledge4">
⦁	We allow you to pledge the share on the very next day of purchase. This gives you an option to create a margin against the shares receivable in the fastest possible time.\n\n
⦁	The above option can also be used for margin funding in case you have bought shares that you wish to be margin funded. At the same time you can also create a collateral for those shares that you have requested to be funded.\n\n
⦁	We explain this via an example : You have bought 100 shares of SBI worth Rs 25000 which you want to be margin funded. So against this 25000 you will need about 30 % as collateral margin. You may create this margin by pledging further shares of about Rs 8000…. ( we give you the option of selecting the shares of your choice )\n\n
⦁	The charges for pledge for margin funding are Rs 35/- and for unpledge of margin funded shares Rs 15/- plus GST in both the cases.\n\n
⦁	Only those shares which can be margin funded would show up in your margin funding option ( please note we do not have the option to margin fund shares bought on the BSE )\n\n
⦁	We advise you to margin fund the shares only when you plan to hold them for more than 7 trading days to avoid paying the higher pledge charges of NSDL\n\n
⦁	You have the option to select shares for margin funding till T + 1 day only. For example: shares bought on Monday you request them to be margin funding till Tuesday 4 pm.\n\n
⦁	The value of margin is seen by you as and when you select the shares to be funded.. ( the system will allow you to margin fund shares as per your ledger balances available with us )\n\n
⦁	If you are in credit there would no option for you to avail the margin funding facility\n\n
⦁	The margin funding is available on all shares in Q / A / B category\n
